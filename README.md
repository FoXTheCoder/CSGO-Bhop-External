 CSGO-Bhop-External is an external script designed to assist with "bunny hopping" (bhop)
 in the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). This script operates outside the game process
 and aims to enhance bunny hopping by monitoring keyboard input and simulating key presses externally.
 This allows for triggering the bunny hop mechanic within the CS:GO game.

- win32gui: It facilitates interaction with the Windows graphical user interface.
- colorama: This library provides capabilities for colored console output.
- os: It enables the execution of operating system commands.
- time: This library is used to introduce time delays.
